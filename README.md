# Mini F1 Manager (Prototype)

What it is
- A tiny browser-based F1 management prototype.
- Manage drivers, budget and a single upgrade across a short season.
- Simulate races and earn points.

How to run
1. Put files (index.html, style.css, data.js, app.js) into a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.

Game basics
- Hire drivers from the pool. Each has a skill and wage.
- Buy a one-time car upgrade for a fixed cost.
- Choose strategy each race (balanced/aggressive/conservative).
- Click "Next Race" to simulate the next round. Season is 6 races by default.
- Results update driver and constructor standings; budget is affected by sponsorship.

Ideas to extend
- Add more upgrade types and research tree.
- More realistic AI and driver contracts.
- Pit stops, tyre compounds, weather, qualifying sessions.
- Persistent backend to store seasons and leaderboards.
- Better UI/UX and animations.

Enjoy! If you'd like, I can:
- Add a trade/transfer market, or
- Expand race simulation (pit stops, tyre wear), or
- Convert to a React/Vue prototype with nicer UI.
